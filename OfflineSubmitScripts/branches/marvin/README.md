Configuration
-----------------

All configurations need to be made in config/offline_processing.cfg.

The most parameters do not need a modification for a next season but at least the start and test runs are required, and the current season.
Detailed information are found in the config file.

Documentation
-----------------

Source in `docs`. Compile with sphinx-apidocs (requires napoleon)
